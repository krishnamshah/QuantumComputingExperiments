# Swap Test Experiment

## Overview
The Swap Test is a quantum algorithm used for comparing two quantum states. It determines how similar two states are without directly measuring the states themselves. This is particularly useful in quantum machine learning and other quantum algorithms.

## Running the Program
To run this experiment, ensure Python and Qiskit are installed. The program sets up a Swap Test to compare two quantum states and measures the ancilla qubit to determine their similarity.

## Understanding the Results
The measurement result of the ancilla qubit tells us about the similarity of the two states. A measurement of |0⟩ indicates that the states are identical, while a measurement of |1⟩ indicates that they are different.
