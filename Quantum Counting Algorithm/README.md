# Quantum Counting Algorithm Experiment

## Overview
The Quantum Counting Algorithm combines Grover's Algorithm with Quantum Phase Estimation to estimate the number of marked items in a quantum database. It is an example of how quantum computing can be used for efficient counting problems.

## Running the Program
Ensure Python and Qiskit are installed to run this experiment. The program demonstrates Quantum Counting by estimating the number of marked states in a superposition of quantum states.

## Understanding the Results
The output of the program is an estimate of the number of marked items. It showcases the utility of quantum algorithms in solving counting problems more efficiently than classical algorithms.
