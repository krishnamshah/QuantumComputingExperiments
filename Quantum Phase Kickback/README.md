# Quantum Phase Kickback Experiment

## Overview
Quantum Phase Kickback is a fundamental concept in quantum computing, where the phase of an eigenstate of a unitary operator is transferred ("kicked back") to a control qubit in a controlled operation. This phenomenon underpins the workings of several quantum algorithms, including Deutsch-Jozsa and Simon's algorithms, showcasing the power of quantum phase manipulation.

## Running the Program
To execute this experiment, ensure you have Python and Qiskit installed. The program illustrates quantum phase kickback using a simple controlled-Z (CZ) operation between two qubits, where one qubit is initially placed in superposition.

### Steps to Run:
1. **Setup**: Ensure Qiskit is installed using `pip install qiskit`.
2. **Execution**: Run the Python script to execute the quantum circuit on a quantum simulator.
3. **Observation**: Analyze the measurement results printed by the script.

## Understanding the Results
The program demonstrates quantum phase kickback by:
- Preparing a control qubit in superposition and a target qubit in a specific state.
- Applying a controlled operation that introduces a phase shift to the target qubit based on its state.
- Observing how this phase shift affects the measurement outcomes of the control qubit.

The results highlight how quantum phase kickback alters the probabilities of measuring certain states of the control qubit, providing insight into the non-classical interactions between entangled qubits in a quantum circuit.

## Conclusion
Quantum Phase Kickback is a key mechanism leveraged in various quantum algorithms to achieve computational advantages over classical approaches. Understanding and utilizing this phenomenon is crucial for advancing quantum computing and its applications.
