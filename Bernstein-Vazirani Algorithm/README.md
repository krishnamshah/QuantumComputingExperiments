# Bernstein-Vazirani Algorithm Experiment

## Overview
The Bernstein-Vazirani Algorithm is an important quantum algorithm that demonstrates quantum computing's superiority over classical computing for specific problems. It efficiently finds a secret string that would take multiple queries to find using classical methods.

## Running the Program
Ensure Python and Qiskit are installed to run this experiment. The program demonstrates the Bernstein-Vazirani Algorithm by finding a secret binary string using a quantum oracle.

## Understanding the Results
The output will reveal the secret string encoded in the oracle. This experiment highlights the ability of quantum algorithms to solve certain problems with fewer queries than classical algorithms.
