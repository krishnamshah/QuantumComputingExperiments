# Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) Experiment

## Overview
The Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) is a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm designed to find the ground state energy of molecules and quantum systems. It's a cornerstone for quantum computing applications in chemistry and material science.

## Running the Program
Ensure Python, Qiskit, and Qiskit's Opflow module are installed to run this experiment. The program outlines the steps for setting up a VQE simulation, including defining an ansatz circuit and calculating its expectation value for a given observable.

## Understanding the Results
The output of the program is the expectation value of the Z observable for the ansatz state parameterized by Î¸. VQE iteratively optimizes the parameters of the ansatz to minimize this expectation value, approximating the ground state energy of the system.
