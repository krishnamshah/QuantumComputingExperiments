# Quantum Teleportation Experiment

## Overview
Quantum teleportation is a fascinating phenomenon in quantum computing and quantum information theory. It involves transferring the state of a qubit from one location to another, using quantum entanglement and classical communication. This experiment demonstrates the basic principles of quantum teleportation.

## Running the Program
Ensure you have Python and Qiskit installed to run this experiment. The program simulates the teleportation of a qubit state across two qubits entangled in a Bell state.

## Understanding the Results
The output demonstrates the successful teleportation of the qubit's state, as evidenced by the measurement results. Quantum teleportation is a cornerstone in the field of quantum computing, with implications for quantum communication and quantum networks.
