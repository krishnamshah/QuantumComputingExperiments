# Quantum Computing Experiments

Welcome to Quantum Computing Experiments! This repository is dedicated to exploring fundamental quantum algorithms and concepts through practical coding examples. Our primary focus is on demonstrating basic principles of quantum computing to those new to the field or interested in its applications.

## About the Project

Quantum computing harnesses the unique behavior of quantum physics, such as superposition, entanglement, and quantum interference, to perform computations. It holds the potential to solve certain problems much faster than classical computers.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Python**: A recent version of Python (3.7 or newer) is required.
- **Qiskit**: We use Qiskit, an open-source quantum computing framework by IBM. Install it using pip:

  ```bash
  pip install qiskit
  ```

```bash
pip install pip-tools
pip-compile deploy/requirements.in
pip install -r deploy/requirements.txt
```  

### Installation

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/krishnamshah/QuantumComputingExperiments.git
```

Navigate to the cloned directory:

```bash
cd QuantumComputingExperiments
```

This experiment is crucial for understanding quantum parallelism and interference.
