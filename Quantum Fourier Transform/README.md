# Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT) Experiment

## Overview
The Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT) is a key algorithm in quantum computing, serving as a critical component in more complex algorithms like Shor's algorithm. The QFT is the quantum analogue of the classical discrete Fourier Transform. It transforms quantum states into their frequency domain, a crucial step in many quantum algorithms.

## Running the Program
To run this experiment, make sure you have Python and Qiskit installed. The program demonstrates the QFT on a simple quantum circuit with 3 qubits.

## Understanding the Results
The output will show the quantum state probabilities in the frequency domain. The QFT's capability to efficiently compute the Fourier Transform of quantum states is fundamental to its utility in quantum computing.
