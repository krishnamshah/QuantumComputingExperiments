# Bell State Experiment

## Overview
This experiment demonstrates the creation of a Bell State, a fundamental concept in quantum computing. A Bell State is a specific quantum state of two qubits that are maximally entangled. In this state, the measurement outcome of one qubit immediately determines the state of the other, regardless of the distance between them.

## Running the Program
To run this experiment, ensure you have Python and Qiskit installed. The program creates a Bell State using a Hadamard gate and a CNOT gate, and then measures the entangled qubits.

## Understanding the Results
The measurement results of the entangled qubits will be either 00 or 11 with equal probability, showcasing quantum entanglement. This is a fundamental phenomenon in quantum mechanics and forms the basis for quantum information theory and quantum computing.
