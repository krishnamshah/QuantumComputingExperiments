# Quantum State Discrimination Experiment

## Overview
Quantum State Discrimination is a fundamental concept in quantum information theory, where the task is to determine which quantum state out of a set of non-orthogonal states a given state belongs to. This problem highlights the limitations and capabilities of quantum measurements.

## Running the Program
Ensure Python and Qiskit are installed to run this experiment. The program demonstrates an attempt to discriminate between two non-orthogonal quantum states using a simple quantum circuit and measurement.

## Understanding the Results
The measurement results give us information about the state, but due to the non-orthogonality of the states, there is no measurement strategy that can perfectly discriminate between them with certainty. This illustrates the probabilistic nature of quantum measurements.
