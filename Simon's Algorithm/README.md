# Simon's Algorithm Experiment

## Overview
Simon's Algorithm is a quantum algorithm that provides an exponential speed-up over classical counterparts for a specific problem known as Simon's Problem. The problem involves finding a hidden string that satisfies a certain property.

## Running the Program
Ensure Python and Qiskit are installed to run this experiment. The program demonstrates Simon's Algorithm by finding a hidden binary string using a quantum oracle.

## Understanding the Results
The output of the program provides information that can be used to deduce the hidden string with high probability. This experiment showcases the potential of quantum algorithms to solve certain problems much more efficiently than classical algorithms.
