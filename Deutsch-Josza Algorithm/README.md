# Deutsch-Josza Algorithm Experiment

## Overview
The Deutsch-Josza algorithm is a quantum algorithm that solves a specific problem exponentially faster than any classical algorithm. This algorithm determines if a given function is constant (all outputs are the same) or balanced (outputs half 0s and half 1s) using a single function evaluation.

## Running the Program
Ensure Python and Qiskit are installed to run this experiment. The program implements an example function, and the algorithm identifies it as constant or balanced.

## Understanding the Results
- If the output is all zeros, the function is constant.
- If there is at least one non-zero bit, the function is balanced.

This experiment highlights the advantage of quantum algorithms in solving specific problems more efficiently than classical computing.
