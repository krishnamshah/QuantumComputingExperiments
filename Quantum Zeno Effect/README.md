# Quantum Zeno Effect Experiment

## Overview
The Quantum Zeno Effect is a situation in which an unstable particle, if observed continuously, will never decay. This experiment demonstrates the Quantum Zeno Effect using a single qubit.

## Running the Program
This program requires Python and Qiskit. It constructs a quantum circuit with a single qubit, applies an X gate to flip the qubit to the |1⟩ state, applies a Hadamard gate to put the qubit into a superposition state, and then measures the qubit.

## Understanding the Results
The output of the circuit will reveal the state of the qubit. If the Quantum Zeno Effect is in play, the qubit will remain in the |1⟩ state despite the Hadamard gate.

## Significance
The Quantum Zeno Effect demonstrates the impact of measurement on the state of a quantum system, a key concept in quantum mechanics and quantum computing.
