# Superposition and Measurement Experiment

## Overview
This experiment demonstrates the fundamental concept of quantum superposition. By applying a Hadamard gate to a qubit, we place it in a state of superposition, where it is simultaneously in both the |0> and |1> states. Upon measurement, this superposition collapses to either |0> or |1> with equal probability.

## Running the Program
To run this experiment, ensure you have Python and Qiskit installed. Execute the program in your Python environment. The output will show the probabilistic nature of quantum measurements.

## Understanding the Results
The result of this experiment is a probabilistic distribution of |0> and |1> states. In an ideal quantum computer, you would expect to see a 50-50 distribution over many runs.
