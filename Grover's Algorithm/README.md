# Grover's Algorithm Experiment

## Overview
Grover's Algorithm is a quantum algorithm for searching an unsorted database with a quadratic speedup over classical algorithms. It's a prominent example of how quantum computing can outperform classical computing in certain tasks.

## Running the Program
Ensure Python and Qiskit are installed to run this experiment. The program demonstrates Grover's Algorithm by searching for a specific state in a superposition of states.

## Understanding the Results
The output will show a higher probability for the searched state, demonstrating the algorithm's ability to amplify the probability amplitude of the desired state in a quantum superposition.
