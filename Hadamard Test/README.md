# Hadamard Test Experiment

## Overview
The Hadamard Test is a quantum algorithm used to calculate the real and imaginary parts of the expectation value of a unitary operator with respect to a certain state. It's a fundamental component in many quantum computing applications.

## Running the Program
Ensure Python and Qiskit are installed to run this experiment. The program demonstrates the Hadamard Test by measuring the real part of the expectation value of the Z operator on the state |1>.

## Understanding the Results
The measurement results from the ancilla qubit provide information about the real part of the expectation value. By analyzing the outcomes, one can infer the expectation value of the unitary operation applied to the system qubit.
