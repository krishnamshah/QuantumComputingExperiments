# Quantum Random Number Generator (QRNG) Experiment

## Overview
A Quantum Random Number Generator (QRNG) utilizes the principles of quantum mechanics to generate truly random numbers. Unlike classical random number generators, QRNGs exploit the inherent randomness of quantum phenomena, such as the superposition of quantum states.

## Running the Program
Ensure you have Python and Qiskit installed to run this experiment. The program creates a quantum circuit with a single qubit in superposition, and the measurement results in a random number.

## Understanding the Results
The output is a random number, either 0 or 1, generated by the collapse of the qubit's superposition state upon measurement. This method of generating random numbers is crucial for applications requiring high levels of randomness, such as cryptography.
