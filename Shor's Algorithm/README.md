# Shor's Algorithm Implementation

This repository contains a Python implementation of Shor's Algorithm using the Qiskit library.

## Requirements

- Python 3.6 or later
- Qiskit

## Installation

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the required packages using pip:

```sh
pip install qiskit
```
## Usage
Run the shor.py script:
```sh
python shor.py
```

This will execute Shor's Algorithm for the number 15 and display a histogram of the results.

## About Shor's Algorithm
Shor's Algorithm is a quantum algorithm for integer factorization. It was invented by Peter Shor in 1994 and was the first quantum algorithm to demonstrate the potential to solve certain problems faster than any classical algorithm.

In this implementation, we use the Quantum Fourier Transform and a custom
