# Deutsch-Jozsa Algorithm Experiment

## Overview
The Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm is a quantum algorithm that provides an exponential speedup over classical algorithms for solving a specific problem. It determines whether a given function is constant or balanced with only one query to the function, showcasing the power of quantum parallelism.

## Running the Program
Ensure Python and Qiskit are installed to run this experiment. The program simulates the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm for an n-bit function and determines its nature (constant or balanced) using a quantum oracle.

## Understanding the Results
The measurement results from the quantum circuit will be all zeros for a constant function and a non-zero bitstring for a balanced function. This outcome demonstrates the algorithm's ability to efficiently solve the Deutsch-Jozsa problem.
