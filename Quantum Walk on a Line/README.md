# Quantum Walk on a Line Experiment

## Overview
A Quantum Walk on a line is a quantum analog of the classical random walk. This concept is important in the development of quantum algorithms and offers insights into the behavior of quantum systems over time.

## Running the Program
Ensure Python and Qiskit are installed to run this experiment. The program simulates a discrete-time quantum walk on a line, demonstrating how a quantum particle moves in a superposition of directions.

## Understanding the Results
The measurement results show the probability distribution of the particle's position after several steps. Unlike classical random walks, the quantum walk spreads out more quickly, demonstrating the quantum interference effects that are characteristic of quantum walks.
