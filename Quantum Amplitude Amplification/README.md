# Quantum Amplitude Amplification Experiment

## Overview
Quantum Amplitude Amplification (QAA) is a technique used in quantum computing to amplify the probability amplitude of a desired quantum state. It's a generalization of Grover's Algorithm and is key in various quantum algorithms.

## Running the Program
To run this experiment, ensure Python and Qiskit are installed. The program demonstrates the QAA technique to amplify the amplitude of a specific quantum state.

## Understanding the Results
The results of the program show an increased probability of measuring the amplified state. This demonstrates how QAA can be used to selectively enhance the probability of desired outcomes in quantum computations.
