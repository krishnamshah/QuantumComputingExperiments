# Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE) Experiment

## Overview
Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE) is a fundamental algorithm in quantum computing. It is used for estimating the phase (or eigenvalue) of a unitary operator, which is crucial in several quantum algorithms, including Shor's factoring algorithm.

## Running the Program
Ensure Python and Qiskit are installed to run this experiment. The program demonstrates QPE by estimating the phase of a Pauli-X gate.

## Understanding the Results
The output will provide an estimate of the phase introduced by the unitary operator. In this experiment, as the Pauli-X gate has a phase of Ï€, the QPE algorithm will estimate this value.
