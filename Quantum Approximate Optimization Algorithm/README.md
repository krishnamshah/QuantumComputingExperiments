# Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) Experiment

## Overview
The Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) is a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm designed to address combinatorial optimization problems. It's particularly well-suited for problems like Max-Cut, which involves dividing a graph into two sets to maximize the number of edges between the sets.

## Running the Program
Ensure Python and Qiskit are installed, along with optimization tools from Qiskit Aqua. The program demonstrates a basic QAOA approach to solve a simple Max-Cut problem on a two-node graph. 

## Understanding the Results
The output includes optimized parameters for the QAOA circuit and the minimum eigenvalue, correlating to the solution of the Max-Cut problem. This experiment showcases how quantum computing can be leveraged for optimization problems, offering potential advantages over classical algorithms.
